# Demo experience
In this lesson, I created an EC2 instance to practice using the CloudWatch interface. I set up an alarm to trigger when the CPU usage reached 15% or higher. To generate load, I installed and ran the `stress` tool using `yum`. I observed the alarm transition from “OK” to “In Alarm” as the CPU usage increased.
