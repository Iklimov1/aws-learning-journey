In this demo I learned how to go through the Route53 interface and create my own domain name. I learned how some domain names are more expensive like .io compared to .com.

I have not purchased a domain name yet, because I am still thinking of a good name and for what specifically, either my baked goods, or a blog-type. 

But I was able to follow along with the demo and see how you can view the domain name in the dashboard.
